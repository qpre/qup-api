I recently tasted this recipe at my local indian restaurant and fell in love with the recipe.
As I could not find a recipe fullfilling my expectations, here's my take at this meal.

**Duration:** 1 hour (preparation + cooking)

**Ingredients :**

 - 2 **chicken** breast.
 - 1 **onion**.
 - 2 **garlic** gloves.
 - 2cm of fresh **ginger**.
 - 50 grams of **butter**.
 - 2 tablespoons of **olive oil**.

 - 250ml of **coconut milk**.
 - 2 **yoghurts** (You can use **vanilla** flavoured ones, I used it as I did not have anything else and it turned out to be a perfect match).

 - 1 coffee spoon **cinnamon**.
 - 1/2 coffee spoon of yellow **curry** powder (optional).
 - 1/2 coffee spoon of **tumeric** powder.
 - 1/2 coffee spoon of **sweet pepper** powder.
 - 5 **cardamon** shells.

 - 30grams **almond** powder.

**Preparation :**

  1. Hash the **onion**, the **garlic** gloves and the **ginger**
  2. Mix it into a sauce pan with the **olive oil** and the **butter**.
  3. Put it over medium heat for 5 minutes, use this time to cut the **chicken** into small dices.
  4. Pour the spices (**cinnamon**, **curry**, **tumeric** and **sweet pepper** powders).
  5. Add the chicken.
  6. Hence it turns white, add the **yoghurt** and the **coconut milk**.
  7. Mix it with the **almond powder** and let it simmer for **30 to 40minutes**. Be careful not to let it burn, and lower the heat strenght it it boils to much.

**tip**: It's best served with a good **Basmati** rice cooked with some **cumin** and **cardamon** seeds. You can also present it with cilantro leafs and minced almonds.
