Here's a quick setup on how to deploy a swift application to an EC2 instance.

**note :** I'm building and deploying a swift application here, but you'll see that you can apply the same recipe for any other stack easily.

Setup your EC2 instance
=======================

First of all you will need an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 14.04

![launch instance](/assets/images/ec2-launch-instance.png =100%x*)

**note :** when setting up your instance, make sure the associated security group allows for SSH connections on port 22.

Install Swift on your instance
==============================

First of all you'll need to be logged in into your session,spawn a terminal an type:

```shell
$ ssh -i <path-to-your-instance-key>.pem ssh://<your-instance-public-dns-address>
```

To install swift on your instance, there is not .deb package yet, but you can do as the [official website](http://swift.org) advises:

1- install the neccessary tools

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install clang libicu-dev
```

2- grab the latest package

```shell
$ wget https://swift.org/builds/ubuntu1404/swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-18-a/swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-18-a-ubuntu14.04.tar.gz
```

3- open it

```shell
$ tar xzf swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-18-a-ubuntu14.04.tar.gz
$ mv swift-2.2-SNAPSHOT-2015-12-18-a-ubuntu14.04 swift
```

**note :** you can test it by running the REPL with `/home/ubuntu/swift/usr/bin/swift`(you can exit it at any moment by typing `:q`)

Setup your git remote
=====================

To trigger our builds and deploys, we will take full advantage of git's distributed architecture.

1- create the git repository:

```shell
$ mkdir my-git-remote.git
$ cd my-git-remote.git
$ git init --bare
```

2- Post-receive hook

You now have a git remote available on your server, but for it to trigger our builds
